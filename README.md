### 🧠 About Me

I am a cybersecurity student with strong hands-on experience in **networking, system security, and security analysis**. My work focuses on building practical labs, security tools, and academic projects that bridge the gap between theory and real-world implementation.

I actively work with **Linux environments**, **Python scripting**, and **network simulation tools** to understand and demonstrate security concepts such as intrusion detection, access control, vulnerability analysis, and secure architecture design.
